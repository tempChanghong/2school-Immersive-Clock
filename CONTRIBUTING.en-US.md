## Ways to Contribute

- Bug fixes (please include reproducible steps and screenshots/recordings if possible)
- Feature improvements (open an issue first to discuss scope and direction)
- Documentation updates (README / docs / copy)
- Performance and accessibility improvements (ARIA / keyboard navigation / large-screen touch UX)

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: `>= 18.0.0` (see `engines.node` in [package.json](./package.json))
- Git
- Package manager: examples use `cnpm` to keep docs consistent (npm/pnpm/yarn are also acceptable)

---

## Local Development

Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/immersive-clock.git
cd immersive-clock
```

Copy env file:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
copy .env.example .env
```

Install deps:

```bash
cnpm install
```

Start web dev server:

```bash
cnpm run dev
```

Start Electron dev:

```bash
cnpm run dev:electron
```

---

## Common Scripts

All scripts are defined in [package.json](./package.json):

```bash
cnpm run build
cnpm run preview

cnpm run lint
cnpm run lint:fix
cnpm run format

cnpm run test
cnpm run test:coverage

cnpm run test:e2e:install
cnpm run test:e2e
```

---

## Branch & Commit Conventions

Suggested branch prefixes:

- `fix/xxx`
- `feat/xxx`
- `docs/xxx`
- `refactor/xxx`
- `test/xxx`

Commit messages should be short, readable, and focused. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a PR:

- Keep the change focused and minimal
- If UI changes are involved, attach screenshots/recordings
- If you fixed a bug, include reproduction steps and the expected behavior
- If you introduce new settings or user-visible behavior, update README or `docs/` accordingly

PR description should include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Compatibility / risks
- What you tested locally

---

## Codebase Conventions

- Prefer TypeScript; avoid `any` and implicit `any`
- Place shared type definitions under `src/types/` when adding new types
- Put reusable UI components under `src/components/`
- Use semantic names (avoid one-letter variables unless extremely local and conventional)
- Styling uses CSS Modules and CSS variables (tokens live in `src/styles/variables.css`)
- Keep accessibility in mind (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, not color-only signals)

---

## Testing & Quality Gate

Recommended minimum before a PR:

```bash
cnpm run lint
cnpm run test
```

If your change affects core flows or UI interactions, also run:

```bash
cnpm run test:e2e
```

---

## Electron Build Notes

Build installers:

```bash
cnpm run dist:electron
```

This runs an Electron-mode build and packages artifacts via `electron-builder`. Output paths and platform differences depend on the project configuration.

---

## Docs & Bilingual Notes

- README is user-facing; contributor/developer details should live in this guide
- User docs and FAQ live under `docs/`
- If your change affects user-facing docs, try to keep Chinese and English docs consistent (at least for entry points and key workflows)

---

## Issues & Security

- For bugs: include steps to reproduce + screenshots/recordings + browser/OS versions if relevant
- For security issues: do not post secrets/tokens/private data in public issues; report via the author’s public contact channels instead
